# GuideToAndroidModernAppArchitecture

This is a sample project to display the list of news with the implementation of Jetpack Compose and updated MVVM Architecture. This project shows latest
architectural approach for developing Android application.

In this project you will find:
* User interface build with Jetpack compose.
* A data layer with a repository and a data source.
* A domain layer with different use-cases.
* Reactive UIs using Flow and coroutines for asynchronous operations.
* Dependency injection using Hilt.

# Why a news app ?
The main objective of this project is to understand the updates on MVVM Architecture easily, but complex enough to showcase the Data, Domain and UI Layer on different scenarios.
